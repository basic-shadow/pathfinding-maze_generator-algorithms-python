# Python Project

# Pathfinding Algorithm

  Implemented A_Star_Pathfinding algorithm in python and set it up in one of python modules, pygame, where that algortihm can be seen in action.
In the main screen_visuals you can choose the start point with the ***Left Click of Mouse***, and the end point with right click of the mouse. After choosing both of the points click additionally left click of the mouse to launch the algorithm to find the path between those two points.


# Maze Generator Algorithms
  Mainly utilized two algorithms to generate maze: ***Recursive Backtracking Algorithm*** and ***Randomized Prim's Algorithm***. Both of these algorithms general implementation code and the logic of accomplishments can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm
  
**Recursive backtracking algorithm**
  As the name says this algorithm generates maze using backtracking recursively. In the program you can generate maze with this algorithm pressing ***SPACE*** with initial average speed, to increase its speed press again ***SPACE***. After completion of maze you can use ***A* Pathfinding Algorithm** to visualize its performance in randomly generated maze.
  
**Randomized Prim's Algorithm**
  This algorithm is based on *Prim's Algorithm*, but connects nodes with its neighbors randomly. In the program to generate maze with this algorithm press ***C*** with average speed, to increase its speed press again ***C***. In the same way, you can check the performance of ***A* Pathfinding Algorithm** after completion of maze.
