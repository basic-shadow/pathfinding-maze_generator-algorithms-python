# Python Project

# Pathfinding Algorithm

  Implemented A_Star_Pathfinding algorithm in python and set it up in one of python modules, pygame, where that algortihm can be seen in action.
In the main screen_visuals you can choose the start point with ***left click of the mouse***, and the end point with right click of the mouse. After choosing both of the points click additionally left click of the mouse to launch the algorithm to find the path between those two points.


# Maze Generator Algorithms
  Mainly utilized two algorithms to generate maze: ***recursive backtracking algorithm*** and ***randomized prim's algorithm***. Both of these algorithms general implementation code and the logic of accomplishments can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm
  
**Recursive backtracking algorithm**
  As the name says this algorithm generates maze using backtracking recursively. In the program you can generate maze with this algorithm pressing ***SPACE*** with initial average speed, to increase its speed press again ***SPACE***. After
